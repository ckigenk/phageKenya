                            <p style="font-size: large; justify-self: center;">PhageKenya is a consortium of researchers that engage in phage research in Kenya. This consortium’s main aim is to create a one-health community building repositories of phages to formulate biological products, highlight phage research, and advocate for their safe use in animal, food industries, and healthcare. Efforts to position Kenya in the world of phage research has been boosted by a pool of scientists trained both in Kenya and abroad. Phages for Global Health has been instrumental in building capacity for phage research by training several African scientists through organized workshops.
                                Microbial drug resistance is a global challenge as it affects the one-health community which includes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the environment. This microbial drug resistance threatens to rescind the gains that have been achieved in the science of treatment, infection prevention and healing, threatening the quality and longevity of the affected life-forms and the overall wellbeing and economic potential of humanity. Phages have the potential to address the global challenge of multidrug resistance (MDR) and provide efficacious solutions to this health challenge. Phages are abundant in nature and specific to their bacterial hosts; therefore, concerted efforts are required to consolidate strategies and pool resources to make them a therapeutic, environmental decontamination, and food safety resource. Phages can be identified to target priority bacterial human and animal pathogens and restore quality of life for those with limited or no antibiotic alternatives rescuing healthcare systems globally from a catastrophic collapse.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Angela Makumi is a Scientist specialized in the field of microbiology, molecular biology, and
bacteriophage biology. Prior to joining ILRI in 2019, Angela was a postdoctoral research fellow in the
Department of Microbiology at the University College Cork, Ireland studying phage-host interactions and
how these interactions affect the dairy industry. Angela holds a Ph.D. in Bioscience Engineering from the
University of KU Leuven, Belgium, an MSc. in Molecular Biology from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels,
Belgium, and a BSc. in Medical Microbiology from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and
Technology- Nairobi, Kenya.  Angela has many years of experience studying the molecular biology of
bacteria and bacteriophage interactions.  She is currently working at ILRI on the use of bacteriophages
as a One Health approach for the replacement of antibiotics, and reduction of drug-resistant
nontyphoidal Salmonella, in poultry farms in Kenya. Been keen on AMR, she is also working on using
bacteriophage-based poultry vaccines to curb Salmonella- a project that is funded by IVVN and IDRC.
Her research interests revolve around zoonotic diseases, bacterial vaccines, innovations as alternatives
to antibiotics, phage-host interactions, phage therapy, and applied research for development with a
focus on Low and middle countries.</p>

                        <h4>Personal Statement</h4><p>
Dr. Atunga Nyachieo is currently the Chief of Research, Institute of Primate Research (IPR), Nairobi,
Kenya. Dr. Nyachieo is a molecular biologist &amp; biochemist. He has a BSc in Biochemistry from Jomo
Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (1999) in Kenya; an MSc in Molecular Biology from
KULeuven, Belgium (2014) and a PhD in Biomedical Sciences (Mechanisms of Human Diseases) from
KULeuven, Belgium (2010). Dr. Nyachieo’s research career focuses pathogenesis of human diseases
(Reproductive diseases &amp; Virology). Since 2015, Dr. Nyachieo started to focus on bacteriophages (also
called phages which are viruses that kill bacteria) mainly as therapy against drug resistant bacteria. Since
then, Dr. Nyachieo has been leading leads a phage team (called IPR phage hunters). So far his phage
team has published n=15 papers and have isolated phages against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Klebsiella pneumonia. Dr. Nyachieo has participated in the two East African phage training workshops (1 st
workshop in Makerere University, Uganda, 2017; 2 nd Workshop at Pwani University, Kilifi, Kenya, 2018)
amongst others. He has also participated and presented the phage research work in several workshops
and conferences including the Biennial conference at Evergreen State College (USA, 2017), the TYAN
conference (Both in Brazil, 2017 and Italy, 2018) and SACIDS conference at Sokoine University (Tanzania,
2018). He has received several grants both for his research work and for short term research visit for
specialized training. Dr. Nyachieo has a phage laboratory where is carrying out his research work and also
using it for training both undergraduate and graduate students. Upto now, in phage research, he has
successfully trained 4 MSc students, 2 PhD and over 100 undergraduate students. Dr. Nyachieo works in
collaboration with Dr. Tobi Nagel (phages for global health, USA), Dr. Benjamin Chan (Yale University,
USA), Prof. Martha Clokie (Leicester University, UK), Dr. Janet Nale Clokie (Leicester University, UK), Prof
Elizabeth Kutter (Evergreen State College, USA) and Dr. Balint Kintses (Biological Research Centre,
Hungary). In addition, he has won several professional awards based on his career including the

<h4>Position Title</h4>  <p>Team Lead PhageKenya, Phage Expert &amp; Consultant


<h4>Education/Training</h4> Master’s in Public Health (MPH), Kenyatta University
Master of science (Biochemistry), Kenyatta University
BSc Biochemistry, Karatina University

<h4> Personal Statement</h4> Ms Ivy Mutai is a Research Fellow and Bacteriophage Specialist
at the Institute of Primate Research (IPR), Nairobi, Kenya. She
is also a Phage Expert &amp; Consultant with the U.S. Army Medical
Research Directorate-Africa (USAMRD-A).
Her research area focuses on infectious diseases under one
health umbrella (human, animal and environmental health). As a
graduate student in 2017, Ivy developed passion for phages
(which are viruses that infect and replicate inside a bacteria).
This was towards finding a long-term solution to the rise in
antimicrobial resistance. During this period, Ivy has been
working with the support and supervision of the Director of
Research, IPR, Dr. Atunga Nyachieo. Through the phage
program, Ivy has successfully trained at least 200
undergraduate students from various higher learning institutions
across Kenya with hands-on phage isolation skills and expertise
while creating awareness on antimicrobial resistance. This
training has so far yielded to 4 MSc students, 2 PhD students
from Sub-Saharan Africa. The program has been focusing on
isolation of lytic phages against multidrug resistant bacteria of
medical relevance such as Acinetobacter baumannii,
Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa etc. Additionally, the program is not limited to extend
its scope to other fields such as Agriculture and Ecology.
Ivy was among the participants in the 2 nd East Africa Phages for
Global Health (PGH) that was held at Pwani University, Kilifi,
Kenya (2018). Following the PGH hands-on training, she

founded a weekly phage discussion forum called IPR phage
hunters at their center with the aim of enriching phage
enthusiasts on the current phage trends and their applicability.
She has also participated and presented her phage research
work in several workshops including the 1 st Kenyan
Bacteriophage Symposium held in Nairobi, Kenya, (2022) and
the World Phage Week held in Ibadan (2022). She is also the
team lead of the Kenya Phage Researchers Group
(PhageKenya) which aims at bringing together phage
enthusiasts to collaborate, network and share more ideas in the
phage field and multidisciplinary sectors.
In addition, Ivy has won the Phage Recognition and
Achievement award through the Evergreen State College,
United States, and the Institute of Primate Research, (2018).
This was based on her excellent work for mentorship through
successful and continuous training phage participants in the
Phage Lab Training Program at the Institute of Primate
Research and other biomedical research institutions across Sub-
Saharan Africa.
