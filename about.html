                            <p style="font-size: large; justify-self: center;">PhageKenya is a consortium of researchers that engage in phage research in Kenya. This consortium’s main aim is to create a one-health community building repositories of phages to formulate biological products, highlight phage research, and advocate for their safe use in animal, food industries, and healthcare. Efforts to position Kenya in the world of phage research has been boosted by a pool of scientists trained both in Kenya and abroad. Phages for Global Health has been instrumental in building capacity for phage research by training several African scientists through organized workshops.
                                Microbial drug resistance is a global challenge as it affects the one-health community which includes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants, and the environment. This microbial drug resistance threatens to rescind the gains that have been achieved in the science of treatment, infection prevention and healing, threatening the quality and longevity of the affected life-forms and the overall wellbeing and economic potential of humanity. Phages have the potential to address the global challenge of multidrug resistance (MDR) and provide efficacious solutions to this health challenge. Phages are abundant in nature and specific to their bacterial hosts; therefore, concerted efforts are required to consolidate strategies and pool resources to make them a therapeutic, environmental decontamination, and food safety resource. Phages can be identified to target priority bacterial human and animal pathogens and restore quality of life for those with limited or no antibiotic alternatives rescuing healthcare systems globally from a catastrophic collapse.</p>

<h4>Position Title</h4>  <p>Team Lead PhageKenya, Phage Expert &amp; Consultant


<h4>Education/Training</h4> Master’s in Public Health (MPH), Kenyatta University
Master of science (Biochemistry), Kenyatta University
BSc Biochemistry, Karatina University

<h4> Personal Statement</h4> Ms Ivy Mutai is a Research Fellow and Bacteriophage Specialist
at the Institute of Primate Research (IPR), Nairobi, Kenya. She
is also a Phage Expert &amp; Consultant with the U.S. Army Medical
Research Directorate-Africa (USAMRD-A).
Her research area focuses on infectious diseases under one
health umbrella (human, animal and environmental health). As a
graduate student in 2017, Ivy developed passion for phages
(which are viruses that infect and replicate inside a bacteria).
This was towards finding a long-term solution to the rise in
antimicrobial resistance. During this period, Ivy has been
working with the support and supervision of the Director of
Research, IPR, Dr. Atunga Nyachieo. Through the phage
program, Ivy has successfully trained at least 200
undergraduate students from various higher learning institutions
across Kenya with hands-on phage isolation skills and expertise
while creating awareness on antimicrobial resistance. This
training has so far yielded to 4 MSc students, 2 PhD students
from Sub-Saharan Africa. The program has been focusing on
isolation of lytic phages against multidrug resistant bacteria of
medical relevance such as Acinetobacter baumannii,
Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa etc. Additionally, the program is not limited to extend
its scope to other fields such as Agriculture and Ecology.
Ivy was among the participants in the 2 nd East Africa Phages for
Global Health (PGH) that was held at Pwani University, Kilifi,
Kenya (2018). Following the PGH hands-on training, she

founded a weekly phage discussion forum called IPR phage
hunters at their center with the aim of enriching phage
enthusiasts on the current phage trends and their applicability.
She has also participated and presented her phage research
work in several workshops including the 1 st Kenyan
Bacteriophage Symposium held in Nairobi, Kenya, (2022) and
the World Phage Week held in Ibadan (2022). She is also the
team lead of the Kenya Phage Researchers Group
(PhageKenya) which aims at bringing together phage
enthusiasts to collaborate, network and share more ideas in the
phage field and multidisciplinary sectors.
In addition, Ivy has won the Phage Recognition and
Achievement award through the Evergreen State College,
United States, and the Institute of Primate Research, (2018).
This was based on her excellent work for mentorship through
successful and continuous training phage participants in the
Phage Lab Training Program at the Institute of Primate
Research and other biomedical research institutions across Sub-
Saharan Africa.

                        <h4>Personal Statement</h4>
                        <p>My research interest has been centred around
the development of diagnostics for medically
important human pathogens, particularly viruses.
A highlight of my work was the application of the
unique single- chain camelid antibodies in
development of a detection method for
Chikungunya virus infections in Kenya. My
research has been interdisciplinary intersecting
with biochemistry, immunology, molecular
biology and virology. In recent years I have
become increasingly interested in viruses that
infect bacteria (bacteriophages), as they hold
promise as effective antimicrobial agents against
pathogenic bacteria, particularly the antibiotic-
resistant strains. I aspire to exploit the potential
of bacteriophage biology, genomics and
engineering to create useful recombinants and
products for applications in phage therapy,
vaccines and biocontrol of bacteria.</p>
